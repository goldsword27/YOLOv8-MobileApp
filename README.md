# Fabric Hole Detection Mobile Application

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a mobile application that can automatically detect holes in fabric using a deep learning model integrated into the app. The system involves training a YOLOv8-based object detection model to identify holes in fabric images and integrating this model into a user-friendly mobile application developed with Flutter. The backend is implemented using FastAPI to facilitate communication between the mobile app and the model.

## Features

- **Automatic Hole Detection**: Utilizes a YOLOv8 deep learning model to detect holes in fabric images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to capture or select images from their gallery.
- **Real-Time Results**: Displays the number of detected holes, their locations, and confidence scores.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Developed using Flutter for both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Efficient Backend Communication**: Uses FastAPI for quick and reliable communication between the app and the model.

## Installation

### Backend

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fabric-hole-detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd fabric-hole-detection/backend
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the FastAPI server**:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Mobile Application

1. **Navigate to the mobile app directory**:

   ```bash
   cd fabric-hole-detection/mobile_app
   ```

2. **Get the Flutter packages**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app on your device or emulator**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open the mobile application**.
2. **On the home screen**, choose to take a photo or select one from your gallery.
3. **After selecting an image**, tap on the "Detect Holes" button.
4. **The app will send the image to the backend server**, which processes it and returns the detection results.
5. **The detected holes will be displayed on the image**, along with the number of holes and confidence scores.
